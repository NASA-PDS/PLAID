 * @file Contains the functions for handling the selection of discipline nodes
 * within the PLAID wizard.
 *
 * Note: Currently, the Geometry node is the only one supported. This is because the JSONs
 * for the other nodes are not yet available at this time. Once they are, their corresponding
 * JSON files will need to be included in the config directory and pointed at in the {@link filePaths}
 * object. The data-id attributes of the discipline node elements in wizard.php will also need to
 * be updated to contain the identifier for the node within the JSON. After that the code will need
 * to be modified to update the {@link g_state.currNS} to the namespace of the current discipline node
 * as the user progresses through them in the wizard.
 *
 * Creation Date: 7/15/16.
